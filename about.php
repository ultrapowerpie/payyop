			<h3>Our Idea</h3>
			<p>paYYop aims to give you your experience, at your own price. Our website 
				features hundreds of experiences for you, ranging from concerts to outdoor adventures hikes.
				Our business model follows that of buying in bulk. Since companies all want to sell their
				items in bulk, we accomplish that for you but grouping you with others who want the
				same experience, saving you the hassle of finding large groups and negotiating
				with the individual companies. </p>

				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<p>Paying your own price is easy! Find the event you want and choose the payment method you would like to execute - it's that easy.</p>

				<h3>What are the different options?</h3>
				<p>We have three different options: Buy now, Buy at the End, or Buy at my Price. 
					With Buy Now, you are choosing to buy your experience right now at the listed price. With Buy at the End,
					you are electing to buy your experience at whatever price it drops to at the end. Finally, Buy
					at my Price locks in your price and only buys the item when it drops to your price. </p>
